## About the Project
The current project concerns the thesis, which I had to implement as part of my studies in the Computer Science 
department at International Hellenic University. Its topic is "Study, design, and development of software for the
controlled access into the workplace of employees with the help of an RFID smartcard and recognition of their face" in this framework, I created this software application for Windows computers in python.
